# farfarbfeld
Farbfeld is a simple image encoding format from suckless.
The Farbfeld specification is at http://git.suckless.org/farbfeld/tree/FORMAT.

This is a fork of a small library called farfbfeld-rs, for which the source
code is no longer available. You can use image-rs if you need a different 
library. I refactored and relicensed the code to use Rust 2021, and removed all 
dependencies.

The original code was stored here, but it's gone:
https://gitlab.com/juggle-tux/farbfeld-rs/commits/master

While the code looks similar for now, I don't expect to keep any compatiblity.
